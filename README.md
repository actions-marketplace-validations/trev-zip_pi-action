Use the [pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent in a GitHub/Gitea/Forgejo action,
with any provider pi supports or any OpenAI-, Anthropic-, or Google-compatible
endpoint such as [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI).

## Examples

### CLIProxyAPI

Point `base-url` at any compatible endpoint. The action adds it to pi's
`models.json` as a `custom` provider (rename it with `provider`) and selects
`model` on it. `api` defaults to `openai-completions`; use `openai-responses`,
`anthropic-messages`, or `google-generative-ai` when the endpoint speaks another
API.

```yaml
name: pi

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  pi:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
        with:
          base-url: https://cliproxy.example.com/v1
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLIPROXY_API_KEY }}
          model: claude-sonnet-5
          token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
          prompt: Update the documentation for the latest changes.
```

The API key only reaches pi through an environment variable; `models.json`
references it as `$PI_ACTION_API_KEY` so the key is never written to disk.

### Built-in Providers

For providers pi already knows, set `provider` and either `api-key` or the
provider's usual environment variable. Omit `model` to use pi's default model
for the provider.

```yaml
- uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
  with:
    provider: anthropic
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    model: claude-opus-5-5
    thinking: high
    token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
    prompt: Fix the failing tests.
```

```yaml
- uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
  env:
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
  with:
    provider: openrouter
    model: moonshotai/kimi-k2
    token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
    prompt: Fix the failing tests.
```

`thinking` accepts `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`;
pi clamps it to what the selected model supports.

### Multiple Providers

`models` accepts pi [`models.json`](https://pi.dev/docs/models) content, or a
path to a file in the workspace. Values can use `$NAME`, `${NAME}`, or
`!command`, which are resolved from the step environment when pi makes a
request. `base-url`, `api`, `api-key`, and `model` are merged on top of the
provider named by `provider`.

```yaml
- uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
  env:
    LOCAL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCAL_API_KEY }}
  with:
    provider: local
    model: qwen3-coder
    models: |
      {
        "providers": {
          "local": {
            "baseUrl": "https://llm.example.com/v1",
            "api": "openai-completions",
            "apiKey": "$LOCAL_API_KEY",
            "models": [{ "id": "qwen3-coder", "contextWindow": 262144 }]
          }
        }
      }
    token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
    prompt: .github/prompts/refactor.md
```

### Subscription Auth

To use a subscription login, run `pi` locally, sign in with `/login`, and store
`~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (as-is or base64 encoded) in the `PI_ACTION_AUTH`
repository secret.

```sh
base64 -w0 ~/.pi/agent/auth.json | gh secret set PI_ACTION_AUTH
```

```yaml
- uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
  with:
    auth: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_AUTH }}
    provider: openai-codex
    model: gpt-5.5
    token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
    prompt: Make the requested repository update.
```

When pi refreshes OAuth tokens during a run, the action stores the new
`auth.json` in the secret named by `auth-secret` (default `PI_ACTION_AUTH`), so
the token needs permission to write Actions secrets. Credentials in `auth.json`
take precedence over `api-key` for the same provider.

### GitHub App

Instead of `token`, pass a GitHub App client ID and private key. The action
creates a repository-scoped installation token with the permissions it needs and
commits as `<app-slug>[bot]`.

```yaml
- uses: spotdemo4/pi-action@main
  with:
    base-url: ${{ secrets.CLIPROXY_URL }}
    api-key: ${{ secrets.CLIPROXY_API_KEY }}
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    client-id: ${{ vars.CLIENT_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
    prompt: Update the documentation for the latest changes.
```

The GitHub App installation must grant these repository permissions:

- Actions: read
- Contents: read and write
- Issues: read and write
- Pull requests: read and write
- Secrets: read and write

### Gitea or Forgejo

On Gitea and Forgejo, pass a token with repository contents, pull request, issue
comment, workflow, and Actions secret access.

### MCP Context

The action gives pi read-only access to the matching platform MCP server with
the same API token used by the action, so pi can inspect pull request comments,
issues, repository data, and workflow context:

- `github-mcp-server` from `github/github-mcp-server` on GitHub, in read-only
  mode with the `repos`, `issues`, `pull_requests`, and `actions` toolsets.
- `gitea-mcp` from `gitea/gitea-mcp` on Gitea, in read-only mode.
- `forgejo-mcp` from `goern/forgejo-mcp` on Forgejo.

On Gitea and Forgejo, pi only sees the read tools for repository contents,
commits, branches, releases, issues, pull requests, and workflow runs. This keeps
write tools away from pi and keeps tool definitions from inflating every model
request.

No container runtime is required. The pi and MCP release binaries are downloaded
and cached in both the runner tool cache and, when available, the Actions cache
service. The action's pi extension starts the MCP server over stdio and exposes
its tools to pi, so this works with released pi versions that have no built-in
MCP support. The API token is forwarded through environment variables and is not
written to the MCP configuration.

Set `PI_PATH` to a preinstalled pi executable to skip the pi download.

### Prompts

If `prompt` points to a file in the workspace, the action reads that file.
Otherwise, the input value is used as the prompt text.

Prompts should describe the task clearly enough for pi to complete it without
follow-up questions: the goal, relevant files, what is out of scope, and which
formatting, build, or test commands to run.

Do not ask pi to commit, push, or post comments. When pi finishes, it submits a
commit message and optional pull request comment, and the action handles
commits, pushes, pull request comments, and automerge.

pi runs with project trust declined, so `.pi` settings, extensions, skills, and
MCP servers from the repository are ignored. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` context
files are still loaded.

Set `dry-run: true` to let pi run and create a local commit while skipping
pushes, pull request comments, and automerge updates. Refreshed auth is still
saved to the configured repository secret.

### Pull Requests

On pull request events, pi can leave a PR comment and optionally toggle
automerge. Non-empty comments include a footer identifying pi and the model used
for the run.

```yaml
name: pi-pr

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  pi:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: https://trev.zip/llc/pi-action@main
        with:
          base-url: ${{ secrets.CLIPROXY_URL }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLIPROXY_API_KEY }}
          model: gpt-5.5
          token: ${{ secrets.PI_ACTION_TOKEN }}
          automerge: true
          prompt: Review this pull request and fix straightforward issues.
```
